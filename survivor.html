Many people ask what they can do to get over a sexual assault and many experts recommend seeking medical care.However,studies have showed that it is very important to see a doctor first either to collect evidence or to just make sure you are okay and feel in control of your body.
<br>

After,this you may decide to seek therapy to heal emotionally.You have just gone through a terrible incident,you feel as though you are at fault ,and you feel invaded.At this point,you may want to press charges against your attacker and that is normal and acceptable howveer do not do it until you feel ready to.For more information on legal assistance click <a href ="#legal">here.</a>
You can also reach out to friends  and family members you trust for support especially since you might be feeling isolated and alone.You are not alone.Do not be afraid and there are a lot of people who unfortunately have gone through horrible incidents like this. 
<br>
<br>
If you do want to go to therapy,you can always attend individual sessions or in group.This way you can share your feelings and learn how to use your feelings in other way and possibly even make friends with people who understand your feeling which might be uncomfortable but are totally normal.

So you are here because you have decided to seek justice for yourself and be a voice for other survivors.Now that you are ready to press criminal charges against the assaulter,it is important you know a few things:

You can ask your landlord to change the locks on your home if you do not feel secure

If you need to leave work because of your safety,you may still be eligible to get unemployment compensation benefits
