	<h3 class=texthead>Listen to them</h3>
			It takes a lot of courage to tell another person about being assaulted therefore when someone does confide in you you should take it seriously and  be open and part of listening is hearing what they want and let them be in control.
	<br>
	<h3 class=texthead>Believe them</h3>
			It is very important to trust the person and hear what they are telling you because every detail is important.
	<br>
	<h4 class=texthead>Encourage them to get help</h4>
			You should encourage the person to go to the police and report but person may not want to go to the police and you should respect that decision and not force them. 
	<br>
	<h5 class=texthead>Be there for them</h5>
			They may just need someone there for them, someone to lean on, and if they chose you to be one of those people then be that person as well as you can.
	<br>
	<h6 class=texthead>Respect their boundaries</h6>
			This person has just been through a traumatic experience and may get uncomfortable with things like contact and everyone is different but when this is the case, respect that and find ways that make them feel comfortable.
	<br>
	<h3 class=texthead>Be healthy</h3>
			Not only should you make sure your loved one is eating and caring for themselves properly but you should make sure you are at you best so you can properly help them.
