	<h2 > What you can do. . .  </h2>
		<p> Sexual assault is a horrible thing, and no two people react the same way. Therefore, there is no <i> right </i> way to help your loved ones after being assaulted. The best thing you can do is adapt to their unique circumstances by carefully reading the situation and acting accordingly. This page details possible actions you can take. Choose the steps that seem best, and follow them in your own way.</p></div>

	<h3 class=texthead>Listen to them. . .</h3>
			<p>It takes a lot of courage to tell another person about being assaulted therefore when someone does confide in you you should take it seriously and  be open and part of listening is hearing what they want and let them be in control.</p>
	
	<h3 class=texthead>Believe them. . .</h3>
			<p>It is very important to trust the person and hear what they are telling you because every detail is important.<p>
	
	<h4 class=texthead>Encourage them to get help. . .</h4>
			<p>You should encourage the person to go to the police and report but person may not want to go to the police and you should respect that decision and not force them. </p>
	
	<h5 class=texthead>Be there for them. . .</h5>
			<p>They may just need someone there for them, someone to lean on, and if they chose you to be one of those people then be that person as well as you can.</p>
	
	<h6 class=texthead>Respect their boundaries. . .</h6>
			<p>This person has just been through a traumatic experience and may get uncomfortable with things like contact and everyone is different but when this is the case, respect that and find ways that make them feel comfortable.</p>
	
	<h3 class=texthead>Be healthy. . .</h3>
			<p>Not only should you make sure your loved one is eating and caring for themselves properly but you should make sure you are at you best so you can properly help them. </p>
