<p> Sex offenders is still an on going problem and in our opinion there is still not enough that has been done about it. There are many organizations such as The National Center for Missing & Explotied Children, Stop Child Predators, National Sexual Violence Resource and RAINN. They are all fantastic organizations that do an amazing job of making the public aware of of all the things you can do to get involved. Even though they are informative and helpful we as citizens have to take action. We know that this subject can be touchy and many people maybe uncomfortable or resistant to try help but just try to empathize and put yourself in the shoes the victim. Anything that anyone does try to help can be super beneficial in the future. Below are some examples of situations in which "justice is being served" but in a very unjust way. </p>
