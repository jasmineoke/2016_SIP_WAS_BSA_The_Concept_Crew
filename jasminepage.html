<p> Sexual assault is an ongoing problem and in our opinion there is still not enough that has been done about it. There are many organizations such as The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, The National Sexual Violence Resource, and RAINN who advocate for sexual assaults victims. They do an amazing job of making the public aware of of all the things you can do to get involved. These organizations are informative and helpful, but we as citizens have to take action. Anything you do to help can be beneficial to sexual assault victims. </p>

    <h2> Sentencing Issues </h2>
   <p>In 2016, Brock Turner, a Stanford athlete raped a 22-year-old intoxicated and unconcious woman with a foreign object. He was reported and convicted by the Santa Clara County Superior Court for three accounts of sexual assault. </p>
    	<p> His counts were: <br>
  	 	 rape of an intoxicated person <br>
   	 	 rape of an unconcious person<br>
     	 assault with intent to rape an intoxicated woman<br>
    	 sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object<br>
   </p>


<p style="text-align: left">Brock Turner may have gotten off easy within the justice system, but in reality, he was lucky. Only an estimated 30% of sexual assaults in the United States are reported to the authorities, and only an estimated 3% of rapists are convicted. So, while many consider Turner unjustly served, he was punished far more than most rapists.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">In every state, there are mandatory minimums that can apply to the sentencing of sex offenders. However, in 2013, only 50.8% were convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty, meaning that about half  sex offenders had no required sentence, making it easier for things like the Brock Turner case to occur. Additionally, the United States Sentencing Commission states that at sentencing, only 14.5% of offenders convicted of crimes with mandatory minimums received sentences that adhered to the mandatory minimum penalty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">And, these loose penalties are likely increasing the amount of sexual assaults in the U.S. This is because repeat offenders are arrested between 30 to 45 times more frequently than the general population.
